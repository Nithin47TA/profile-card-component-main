### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 



### What I learned

 This is a relatively simple task for newbie web developers so there is not much of a take away i just needed to refresh my css and html 
 


```css
.profile-card{
   position: relative;  
}


.person{
    position: absolute;
}
```
  this is something that i forgot about so i thought i will mention it, for centering the image I used **absolute** withought thinking it is affected by the `relative` position of card

### Continued development

 I am really comfortable with **css** and **html** so i would like to incoperate other technologies udsed in web development



### Useful resources

- [MDN WebDocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is one of the richest and most usefull documentation for web developers.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - I used this as an introduction to web development.
